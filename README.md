# Code Refactor 

## Description

This challenge involved refactoring a small static marketing website fir Horiseon that had non semantic html tags and repeated code in CSS.
My task was to make the website more accessible by using semantic html tags and having DRY code in CSS.

## Getting Started

## 1

Here is an example of how the code of the content looked in html.

Here are the changes I made to the header content. As you can see, the first action was to removeand replace all div tags were replaced with semtanic HTML tag - that being, one header tag and then subsequent nav tags. I also removed redundant list item tags. Figure tags were supplemented for the main image on the site.

CSS was also updated to respond to the removed header class.
